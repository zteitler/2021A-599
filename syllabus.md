## Grading

### Components of course grade

This class is graded pass/fail.

A passing grade will be earned primarily by participation.
There will be some written assignments and maye a presentation
at the end of the semester.
Students will be asked to attend some colloquium and/or seminar talks if possible.

### Written assignments

#### Turning in written assignments

Homework submissions and grading will be paperless.
You will turn in your homework by uploading PDFs
to BlackBoard and/or GradeScope.

#### Homework formatting

Homework must be typed in LaTeX.
LaTeX tutorials are available online, e.g.,
<https://www.latex-tutorial.com>
and <https://www.gnu.org/software/teximpatient/>.
You may wish to use a free online LaTeX system such as <https://overleaf.com>.
(Overleaf includes a LaTeX tutorial.)

For legibility, use the `12pt` option (`\documentclass[12pt]{amsart}`)
and `\linespread{2.4}`.
If you use figures, I recommend learning to use `TikZ` to generate high-quality figures
within LaTeX.
Alternatively you may use figures/plots generated in other programs
such as Sage, Mathematica, Maple, or Inkscape,
saved to PDF, and included in your document with commands like `\includegraphics`.
It's also fine to include hand-drawn figures that you scanned or photoed.
