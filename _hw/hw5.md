## Assignment

1.  Add to your cv. Suggested categories are:
    + teaching experience
    + research interests (5-20 words)
    + publications
    + fellowships, grants, honors, awards
    + presentations and posters
    + conferences attended
    + professional affiliations (professional societies such as AMS, MAA, SIAM)
    + skills (relevant professionally: languages, computer skills, etc)
    
    Within each category, list items in reverse chronological order (most recent at the top).
    Adjust the ordering, combine or split categories to emphasize most important highlights.
    
    For now we are focusing on content, not formatting.
    
    You won't be graded on the content of your CV. If you don't have much to list, that's okay.
    
    **Upload your cv to gradescope.**



2.  Read
    <https://marktomforde.com/academic/gradstudents/AMSarticles/GrantWriting-Brennan.pdf>.
    Focus on the two review criteria,
    *intellectual merit* and *broader impact*.
    (This article is about grants from the NSF, National Science Foundation.
    Other agencies and foundations use different criteria and priorities for their grants.
    But usually the criteria are at least somewhat similar to these NSF ones.)
    (You can pretty much ignore some of the other topics such as formatting, deadlines,
    budgeting, and reporting post-award.)


3.  Start preparing a draft version of your mock grant proposal, including
    + Description of proposal topic
    + Why someone would want to know about your topic--the intellectual merit
    + How your project will benefit society--the broader impact
    
    This is leaving out the plan of how you will tackle your project.
    We'll add that later. For now, please start with these other parts.
    
    You can be somewhat creative in broader impacts.
    This goes beyond the direct impacts of the project within its topic.
    The *broader* impacts can be in areas such as teaching, dissemination (giving talks on your project),
    training students and junior researchers (e.g., if you will use grant money to pay for a grad student's RAship),
    bringing mathematics to broader society and the non-mathematical community...
    
    Please start gathering your ideas and planning how you'll write this.
    It will be formally assigned in 1-2 weeks from now.


4.  Related to Ph.D. program applications:
    Read <https://marktomforde.com/academic/mathmajors/KissesOfDeath.html>.
    Some of the advice here seems reasonable, but there are also some items that I disagree with.
    Please don't read this as advice that you have to follow.
    Instead, look at it as a starting point that you can consider, and then decide for yourself.
    We'll discuss it more in our meeting.
