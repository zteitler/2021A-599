## Assignment

The assignment has three parts:

1.  Mock Grant Proposal: write a description of your research subject.
    **You will turn this in on gradescope.**

2.  Reading: Visit some websites with information and resources about math grad school
    and BIG careers. You don't have to read them all the way through, just visit.
    And you don't have to turn in anything.

3.  Web site: Create your web site.

Details are below.

## Mock Grant Proposal

This is a continuation of the project started in [Homework 2](hw2).

Describe the research subject of your mock grant proposal.
This is not the actual grant research statement, just your description of the topic.
Your description should include:
1.  What is the research problem or project you want to propose working on (or studying).
2.  The general area (or areas) of mathematics, e.g., algebra, topology, modeling, mathematics education, etc.
3.  At least one goal, or conjecture, or method you will use, or key idea.

Turn in your research subject description on Gradescope.

This is intended as preparation for writing the research statement of your proposal.


## Reading

1.  Visit [AMS information about graduate programs](http://www.ams.org/education/pre-grad).
    You don't have to read all of it, just skim over it and see if there is anything there that is useful for you.

2.  Non-academic careers: BIG stands for Business, Industry, and Government,
    and encompasses a wide range of careers that a math student might be interested in.
    Visit the [AMS BIG career page](http://www.ams.org/profession/career-info/big)
    and the [BIG Math Network](https://bigmathnetwork.org).
    Again, you don't have to read through these pages, just skim over them.


## Web site

Create your web site.
I strongly recommend to use [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com).

I want your web site to:
1.  State your name.
2.  State that you are a graduate student in mathematics at Boise State University.
In the future we will add more, for example a description of your research interests.
For now, anything else you wish to add (e.g., photo, teaching activities, your CV)
is welcome, but not required.

When your web site is created, send me an email with the URL (web address)
so that I can visit it.
Also, let me know if it's okay to share your web site with other people
(e.g., other students in the seminar, other people in the math department).

### Privacy
You do **not** need to make your web site public if you prefer not to.

If you have any concerns about creating a public web site,
you may use Google Sites settings to restrict your site, either to Boise State users
(so that your site can only be viewed by people logged in to their Boise State account),
or even to a specified list of users (e.g., just me).
